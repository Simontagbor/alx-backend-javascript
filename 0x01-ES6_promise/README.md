# 0x01. ES6 Promises
` JavaScript ` ` ES6 `

## Introduction
In this project I had fun learning about how promises can be used to control and  manage asynchronous operations. I also learned to use async and await to work more effectively with promises and ansynchronous code in a synchronous fashion.

### 0. Keep every promise you make and only make promises you can keep
In this task i simply returned a promise with a specifed prototype `getResponsfromAPI `

### 1. Don't make a promise...if you know you can't keep it
In this task i used a given prototype to return a promise with a boolean parameter

### 2. Catch me if you can!
for this task I introduced three handlers for a given function. 
Each handler is responsible for a given state of the promise. i.e pending, rejected or fulfilledd.

### 3. Handle multiple successful promises
For this task i worked with multiple promise objects

### 4. Simple promise
